# Alzheimouille Pack

## Project

Alzheimouille Pack is a datapack (and resource pack) originally meant for a private server but it is freely usable if you like it.

## Features

Mainly QoL additions and fun things, which are:

- Multiple recipes:
  - Added all **Wood** in the stonecutter
  - Added a **Sadle** recipe (3 leathers, 2 iron and 2 string in a reversed U shape)
  - Added a **Name Tag** recipe (5 papers and a string)
  - New **Invisible Item Frame** recipe (usual craft but with a glass plane instead)
  - New **Invisible Glowing Item Frame** recipe (usual craft but with a glass plane instead and a glow ink sac at the bottom middle)
  - Added a **Amethyst Block** to **Amethyst Shard** recipe
- Multiple advancements:
  - Number of death
  - Number of kill
  - Number of diamond mined
  - Total playtime

## Plan

Not much yet but here's a list of things I would like to change or the future:

- Make **Invisible Glowing Item Frame** use an **Invisible Item Frame** in the craft - NOT YET POSSIBLE
