# Alzheimouille Pack

## Project

Alzheimouille Pack is a datapack (and resource pack) originally meant for a private server but it is freely usable if you like it.

## Features

This datapack isn't focused on one thing but more on fun or QoL changes that we liked. Here's a list of the features you can find in this pack:

- Multiple recipes (since `v1.7.0` they also get unlocked like vanilla recipe do):
  - Added all **Wood** in the stonecutter
  - Added a **Sadle** recipe
  - Added a **Name Tag** recipe
  - Added a **Amethyst Block** to **Amethyst Shard** recipe
  - New **Invisible Item Frame** recipe (usual craft but with a glass plane instead) + custom texture
  - New **Invisible Glowing Item Frame** recipe (usual craft but with a glass plane instead and a glow ink sac at the bottom middle)
- Multiple advancements:
  - Number of death
  - Number of kill
  - Amount of diamond (block) mined (stone and deepslate ore are combined)
  - Total playtime

As for the resource pack, the features are:
- Translations:
  - English (default `fallback` if not installed)
  - French
- Custom item textures:
  - Invisible Item Frame (item)

## Plan

Not much yet but here's a list of things I would like to change for the future:

- Add a custom texture for the **Invisible Glowing Item Frame**
- Make **Invisible Glowing Item Frame** use an **Invisible Item Frame** in the craft - Not possible due to not *yet* being able to use components in input
- Make **Invisible (Glowing) Item Frame** drop the custom item instead of standard **Item Frame**
- Possibly add more advancements type in the future
